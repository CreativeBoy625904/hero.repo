            <h3> DEVOLOPING IS MY PASSION </h3>
            <p>Typically, when someone hears ‘medical field’, automatically you think of people with white lab coats and a stethoscope
            around their neck ready to take your vitals. Obviously this comes to mind because these doctors and surgeons are the
            face of the medical field, but in reality there is so much more. There are actually about 300 different occupations one
            can have in the health care field. A large part of that is nurses. Nurses are the basis of the medical field; they are
            almost as important as the patients themselves. They have always been a major part of our lives. Nurses have been with
            us since we first opened our eyes, from birth to broken bones, nurses were there. They have very difficult and extensive
            careers, they dedicate their lives to their work and to their patients. Some nurses spend long nights away from their
            family and friends to help others, at times their shifts can last as long as 24 hours. In my opinion nurses are the real
            super heroes, for this reason I have decided to pursue a major in nursing. I still have a lot to learn and many years of
            schooling to go, but personally its worth the wait.

            <h1>I LOVE DEVOLOPEING</h1>
            <h3>I LOVE MAKEING NEW things</h3>
            <p>My occupation of choice is web designer, and I chose this because even though I don’t know everything about computers
                I
                am very fast at learning about them. It’s never too late to start this occupation and I know if I put time and
                effort
                into this\ I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a web designer I will create and keep up with websites,
                including the layout, and function according to the client. (Web Developer) Web designing has really developed over
                time
                ever since the “World Wide Web” was created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility. The
                requirements for this occupation vary with what kind of work that they do, they can range from a high school diploma
                to
                a bachelor’s degree. Thoughe</p>

        <p>When you think of a superhero one normally thinks of Spiderman, Batman, or Superman, but there were superheroes long before these characters were created. First one must understand that the basis of this name is hero. What is a hero? A hero is a person who does something special or out of the ordinary in order to help others. It could also be someone who is admired for a characteristic about them, be it physical or mental. They are individuals that normal everyday people can look up to.
